title: Bruce had me up to three miles a day, really at a good pace.  We’d run three
  miles in twenty-one or twenty-two minutes.  Just under eight minutes a mile.  So
  this morning he said to me “We’re going to go five.”  I said, “Bruce, I can’t go
  five.  I’m a helluva lot older than you are, and I can’t do five.”  He said, “When
  we get to three, we’ll shift gears and it’s only two more and you’ll do it.”  I
  said “Okay, hell, I’ll go for it.”  So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile
  and I’m okay for three or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out.  I’m
  tired, my heart’s pounding, I can’t go any more and so I say to him “Bruce if I
  run anymore,”—and we’re still running—“if I run anymore I’m liable to have a heart
  attack and die.”  He said, “Then die”.  It made me so mad that I went the full five
  miles.  Afterward I went to the shower and then I wanted to talk to him about it.  I
  said, you know, “Why did you say that?”  He said, “Because you might as well be
  dead.  Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything
  else, it’ll spread over into the rest of your life.  It’ll spread into your work,
  into your morality, into your entire being.  There are no limits.  There are plateaus,
  but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.  If it kills you, it kills
  you.  A man must constantly exceed his level.”
